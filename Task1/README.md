# Task 1: Computer Vision using CNN Models

**Name:** Safa Anium
**Regd. No.:** INBT022841
**Course ID:** AIINB10726

## Overview
This folder implements both parts of Task 1 on the CIFAR-10 dataset:
- **Part A** — a traditional, un-regularized CNN baseline.
- **Part B** — a customized CNN with batch normalization, dropout, an extra
  conv block, data augmentation, and a learning-rate schedule, aimed at
  measurably beating Part A.

Both parts share the exact same random seed and train/val/test split
(`data_utils.py`), so the comparison between them is fair.

## Files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data_utils.py` | Loads CIFAR-10, normalizes it, and creates the fixed train/val/test split used by both parts |
| `eval_utils.py` | Shared metric reporting, confusion matrix plotting, training-curve plotting |
| `part_a_traditional_cnn.py` | Builds, trains, and evaluates the baseline CNN |
| `part_b_customized_cnn.py` | Builds, trains, and evaluates the improved CNN |
| `compare_models.py` | Prints the final side-by-side comparison table |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

## How to run (in VS Code / terminal)
```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run Part A first (creates part_a_results.json + the saved model)
python part_a_traditional_cnn.py

# 4. Run Part B (automatically compares itself to Part A's results file)
python part_b_customized_cnn.py

# 5. Print the final comparison table for your report
python compare_models.py
```

Each script also saves:
- `training_curves_<model>.png` — training vs validation accuracy/loss
- `confusion_matrix_<model>.png` — confusion matrix over the 10 CIFAR-10 classes
- `part_<a|b>_model_summary.txt` — full Keras architecture printout (use this as your architecture diagram, or paste the layer list into draw.io/Lucidchart for a nicer visual)
- `part_<a|b>_results.json` — all numeric results in one place for your Google Doc report

## Architecture summary
**Part A (Traditional CNN):** 3 conv blocks (64→128→256 filters, two conv layers each) with ReLU + max pooling, followed by a 512-unit dense layer. No batch norm, dropout, or augmentation — this is the clean baseline.

**Part B (Customized CNN):** Same conv-block philosophy but deeper (adds a 4th block up to 512 filters), with batch normalization after every conv layer, dropout for regularization, on-the-fly data augmentation (flip/rotation/zoom), and a ReduceLROnPlateau learning-rate schedule.

## Success thresholds
- Part A: ≥ 70% test accuracy on CIFAR-10.
- Part B: beats Part A's test accuracy by ≥ 3 percentage points.

Run the scripts and copy the printed numbers into your Google Doc report along with the generated PNGs.
